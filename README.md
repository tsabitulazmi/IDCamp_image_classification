# IDCamp Data Scientist - Machine Learning Final Project
Image Classification Project of Hand Gesture (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
This project is part of my Data Scientist learning path in IDCamp-Dicoding.

## Project Goal
The project goal is to classificate image of hand gesture by three classess (rock, paper, and scissors). The classification model was developed using Tensorflow library and created in Google Colaboratory.

## There are several steps in workng on this project:
- Import Data and Library needed
- Manage directory
- Split train and validation image
- Augmentation and generate image data
- Model training
- Model Validation
